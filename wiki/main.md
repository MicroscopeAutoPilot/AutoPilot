# AutoPilot - Core optimisation algorithms for accurate and robust multi-plane focusing in light-sheet microscopes 


Long term live imaging of developmental processes with multi-illumination, multi-color, multi-view light sheet microscopy demands exquisite optical alignments. Large specimens introduce significant refractive aberrations that require spatial adaptability. Thermal and mechanical drift as well as the specimenâ€™s own development degrade alignment quality over time. 
To maintain optimal image quality throughout a whole experiment we developed a smart multi-illumination, multi-color, multi-view light-sheet microscope capable of spatio-temporal adaptive focusing. Image quality is continuously monitored and corrected at different axial depths within the specimen. The core optimization algorithms for accurate and robust multi-plane focusing are generic and applicable to other multi-illumination multi-detection light sheet microscopes. It is released as the open source AutoPilot project. 
We demonstrate this novel technology with high-quality time-lapse recordings of the cellular dynamics of Zebrafish and Drosophila embryos.
