### Abstract ###

Light-sheet microscopy is a powerful method for imaging the development and function of biological systems. In order to successfully produce high-resolution images, these microscopes must achieve perfect overlap between the thin sheet of light used to illuminate the sample and the focal plane of the objective used to form an image. Whenever this co-planarity is violated, spatial resolution and image contrast immediately suffer.
Unfortunately, living specimens have complex optical properties that are not only heterogeneous in space but also dynamic in time, which typically leads to significant, spatiotemporally variable mismatches between light-sheet and detection planes. Achieving and maintaining high spatial resolution thus critically requires an automated framework capable of continuously analyzing and optimizing the spatial relationship between light-sheet and detection planes across the specimen volume and in real-time.
Here, we present such a general framework for spatiotemporally adaptive imaging, which integrates (1) a multi-view light-sheet microscope capable of digitally translating and rotating light-sheet and detection planes in three dimensions and (2) a fully automated computational framework that rapidly analyzes and continuously optimizes spatial resolution across the specimen volume in real-time. We demonstrate the strength of our approach by performing high-resolution live imaging of entire developing zebrafish and Drosophila embryos. We show that our framework improves spatial resolution and signal-to-noise ratio 2- to 5-fold, recovers cellular and sub-cellular structures in many anatomical regions that are not resolved by non-adaptive imaging, automatically adapts to spatiotemporal dynamics of genetically-encoded fluorescent markers and robustly optimizes imaging performance during large-scale morphogenetic changes in living organisms. The high level of microscope automation realized by our framework furthermore allows non-expert users to take full advantage of light-sheet microscopy and produce image data of optimal quality. The optimization theory and implementation of our method are general and readily adapted to other light-sheet microscope designs. Our framework is released as the open-source AutoPilot project.
